                Boracay’s White Beach is a tropical paradise like no other. By

              <h5>What I dont like about it</h5>
              <p>
                Over-tourism has led to overcrowding, especially during peak
                seasons. Despite recent rehabilitation efforts, environmental
                concerns and waste management remain challenges. Prices for
                accommodations, food, and activities tend to be higher than in
                other beach destinations in the Philippines. So, don't come on a
                peak season. Enjoy the place and also good for your wallet.

              <h4>Palawan Mandala Spa & Resort Villas</h4>
              <p>
                Often called the "Last Frontier," Palawan is a dream destination
                with its crystal-clear lagoons, dramatic limestone cliffs, and
                hidden beaches. Explore the enchanting underground river in
                Puerto Princesa, snorkel in the vibrant coral gardens of Honda
                Bay, or sail through the breathtaking islands of El Nido and
                Coron. Every moment in Palawan is a postcard-perfect adventure.

              <h5>What I dont like about it</h5>
              <p>
                While Palawan is stunning, its popularity means some areas can
                get crowded, especially El Nido and Coron. Infrastructure in
                remote parts is still developing, leading to occasional power
                outages and limited internet connectivity. Additionally, getting
                around can be challenging due to long boat or van rides between
                attractions.

              <h4>SM Mall of Asia</h4>
              <p>
                SM Mall of Asia (MOA) is one of the largest shopping malls in
                the world, offering a vast selection of retail stores, dining
                options, and entertainment hubs. The mall’s seaside location
                provides stunning sunset views along Manila Bay, making it a
                great spot for leisurely walks. It also features an
                Olympic-sized skating rink, IMAX theater, and concert venues,
                ensuring there’s something for everyone. The mall is
                well-maintained, modern, and has a vibrant atmosphere, perfect
                for families and tourists alike.
              </p>
              <h5>Address</h5>
              <p>
                SM Mall of Asia, Seaside Blvd, Pasay, 1300 Metro Manila,
                Philippines
              </p>

              <h5>What I don't like about it</h5>
              <p>
                Despite its appeal, SM MOA can be overwhelmingly crowded,
                especially on weekends and holidays, making navigation
                difficult. The vast size means long walking distances between
                sections, which can be tiring. Traffic congestion around the
                area is also a major downside, with parking often a challenge.
                Additionally, while the mall offers high-end and budget-friendly
                options, some restaurants and shops are relatively pricey
                compared to other malls in the Philippines. So, just avoid going
                there on a weekend!
