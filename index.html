          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Margaret Cezar, and I am originally from the Philippines.
            I currently reside in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. While I was born in
            the Philippines, I have not had the chance to explore the entire
            country, including its many beautiful tourist spots. If you are
            looking for insights or inspiration, I encourage you to explore this
            website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I also created this page as part of a project for SheCodes
            Responsive to develop my coding skills.
